# SQL-Based Pizza Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a deep-dive analysis of a relational pizza sales database using advanced SQL. By leveraging complex queries, including `JOINS`, subqueries, and window functions, the analysis uncovers key business drivers, product performance metrics, and sales trends.

The insights derived from this analysis provide a clear, data-driven roadmap for optimizing menu pricing, focusing promotional efforts, improving inventory management, and shaping overall business strategy.
